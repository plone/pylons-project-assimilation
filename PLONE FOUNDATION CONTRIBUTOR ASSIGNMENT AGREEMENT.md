CONTRIBUTOR ASSIGNMENT AGREEMENT
================================

For good and valuable consideration,
receipt of which I acknowledge,
I, _____________________________________ (Name),
hereby transfer to The Plone Foundation ("Foundation") my entire right, title, and interest (including all rights under copyright) in the program _____________________________________ (“Program”),
including original code, accompanying documentation and supporting files,
changes and enhancements to the Program code and accompanying files,
and all future modifications of the Program code and accompanying files,
subject to the conditions below.
The original code, files, changes and enhancements, and modifications are herein called the "Work".

For the purposes of this contract,
a work "based on the Work" means any work that in whole or in part incorporates or is derived from all or part of the Work.
The Foundation promises that the Work and any work "based on the Work" distributed by the Foundation or its assignees will be distributed under the GNU General Public License v2 or any later version,
or any other license determined to be a free software license by the Free Software Foundation (“FSF”) or approved as an open source license by the Open Source Initiative (“OSI”).
However, the Foundation may also distribute the Work and any work “based on the Work” under other terms as well.

The Foundation promises that any program "based on the Work" offered to the public by the Foundation or its assignees shall be offered in the form of machine-readable source code,
in addition to any other forms of the Foundation's choosing.
However, the Foundation is free to choose at its convenience the media of distribution for machine-readable source code.

The Foundation hereby grants me a royalty-free non-exclusive license to use or sub-license the Work assigned hereunder
(i.e., if I am assigning changes and enhancements to the Program to the Foundation, the license granted by the Foundation to me is only for those changes and enhancements to the Program I assigned,
it is not for the Program which I changed or enhanced itself) for any purpose.
The Foundation's rights shall otherwise continue unchanged.

I hereby agree that if I have or acquire hereafter any patent, copyright or other interest or right that is infringed or violated by the Program or use of the Program,
such dominating interest or right will not be used to undermine the effect of this assignment,
i.e. the Foundation and the general public are or will be licensed to use,
in the Program and its derivative works,
without royalty or limitation,
the subject matter of the dominating interest or right.
This license provision will be binding on my heirs, assignees, or other successors to the dominating interest or right,
as well as on me.

I hereby represent and warrant that I am the sole copyright holder for the Work and that I have the right and power to enter into this contract.
I hereby indemnify and hold harmless the Foundation,
its officers, employees, and agents against any and all claims, actions or damages
(including reasonable attorney's fees) asserted by or paid to any party on account of a breach or alleged breach of the foregoing warranty.
I make no other express or implied warranty
(including without limitation, in this disclaimer of warranty, any warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE).
