members. They are welcome at all Board events, such as Board meetings
and Board retreats, except those events designated for voting board

recommending to the members, any action or matter expressly required by

directors or otherwise, both as to action in their official capacities
and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, (ii)
continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, and (iii) inure
to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a
person. The Corporation's obligation to provide indemnification under
this Article 9 shall be offset to the extent of any other source of
indemnification or any otherwise applicable insurance coverage under a
policy maintained by the Corporation or any other person.

Expenses incurred by a director of the Corporation in defending a civil
or criminal action, suit or proceeding by reason of the fact that he is
or was a director of the Corporation (or was serving at the
Corporation's request as a director or officer of another Corporation)
shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of
such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on
behalf of such director to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be
determined that he is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation
as authorized by relevant sections of the General Corporation Law of
Delaware. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Corporation shall not be
required to advance such expenses to an agent who is a party to an
action, suit or proceeding brought by the Corporation and approved by a
majority of the Board of Directors of the Corporation that alleges
willful misappropriation of corporate assets by such agent, disclosure
of confidential information in violation of such agent's fiduciary or
contractual obligations to the Corporation or any other willful and
deliberate breach in bad faith of such agent's duty to the Corporation
or its members.

The foregoing provisions of this Article 9 shall be deemed to be a
contract between the Corporation and each director who serves in such
capacity at any time while this bylaw is in effect, and any repeal or
modification thereof shall not affect any rights or obligations then
existing with respect to any state of facts then or theretofore existing
or any action, suit or proceeding theretofore or thereafter brought
based in whole or in part upon any such state of facts.

The Board of Directors in its discretion shall have power on behalf of
the Corporation to indemnify any person, other than a director, made a
party to any action, suit or proceeding by reason of the fact that he,
his testator or intestate, is or was an officer or employee of the
Corporation.

To assure indemnification under this Article 9 of all directors,
officers and employees who are determined by the Corporation or
otherwise to be or to have been "fiduciaries" of any employee benefit
plan of the Corporation that may exist from time to time, Section 145 of
the General Corporation Law of Delaware shall, for the purposes of this
Article 9, be interpreted as follows: an "other enterprise" shall be
deemed to include such an employee benefit plan, including without
limitation, any plan of the Corporation that is governed by the Act of
Congress entitled "Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974,"
as amended from time to time; the Corporation shall be deemed to have
requested a person to serve an employee benefit plan where the
performance by such person of his duties to the Corporation also imposes
duties on, or otherwise involves services by, such person to the plan or
participants or beneficiaries of the plan; excise taxes assessed on a
person with respect to an employee benefit plan pursuant to such Act of
Congress shall be deemed "fines."
